## Reflection

Using GenAI significantly accelerated the learning process. The prompts helped me:
- Quickly understand Go's syntax and conventions
- Troubleshoot setup issues efficiently
- Learn best practices for Go web development

The combination of AI assistance and traditional documentation created a comprehensive learning experience that would be valuable for any beginner starting with Go.
